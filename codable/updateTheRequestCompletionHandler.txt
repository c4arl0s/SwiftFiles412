you now have an initializer for the photoInfo type that the JSONDecoder can use to decode JSON into a PhotoInfo object. Next, you will need to update the completion handler in your network request so the it uses the new type instead of printing the json value. Add a line to your if-let check to initialize an instance of PhotoInfo, then print the value:

let task = URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: url) { (data, response, error) in
				let jsonDecoder = JSONDecoder()
