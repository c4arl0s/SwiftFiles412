what did you do before ?
- serialize JSON data into native Swift types.

You have to prepare to serialize the data into your own custom model objects.

{
  "date": "2017-02-13",
  "explanation": "Juno just completed its fourth pass near
  Jupiter...",
  "hdurl": "http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1702/JupiterSouth_JunoPeach_1200.jpg",
  "media_type": "image",
  "service_version": "v1",
  "title": "Cloud Swirls around Southern Jupiter from Juno",
  "url": "http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1702/
  JupiterSouth_JunoPeach_960.jpg"
}

struct PhotoInfo {
	var title: String
	var description: String
	var url: URL
	var copyright: String?
}
