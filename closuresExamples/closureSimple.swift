let simpleClosure = {   
}
simpleClosure()
// ===================

// In the above syntax, we have declared a simple closure { } that takes no parameters, 
// contains no statements and does not return a value. 
// This closure is assigned to the constant simpleClosure.

// We call the closure as simpleClosure(), but since it doesn't contain any statements, the program does nothing.
