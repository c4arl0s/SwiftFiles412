In computer programming, a callback, also known as a "call-after[1]" function, is any executable code that is passed as an argument to other code that is expected to call back (execute) the argument at a given time.
This execution may be immediate as in a synchronous callback, or it might happen at a later time as in an asynchronous callback.

Design: There are two types of callbacks: differing in how they control data flow at runtime:
- blocking callbacks (also known as synchronous callbacks or just callbacks)
- deferred callbacks (also known as asynchronous callbacks).
