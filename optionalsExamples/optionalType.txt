You use the Optional type whenever you use optional values, even if you never type the word Optional. 
Swift’s type system usually shows the wrapped type’s name with a trailing question mark (?) instead of showing the full type name. 
For example, if a variable has the type Int?, that’s just another way of writing Optional<Int>. 
The shortened form is preferred for ease of reading and writing code.

The types of shortForm and longForm in the following code sample are the same:

let shortForm: Int? = Int("42")
let longForm: Optional<Int> = Int("42")
