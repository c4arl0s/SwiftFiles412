What are optionals for?

Optionals have two use cases:

Things that can fail (I was expecting something but I got nothing)
Things that are nothing now but might be something later (and vice-versa)
Some concrete examples:

- A property which can be there or not there, like middleName or spouse in a Person class
- A method which can return a value or nothing, like searching for a match in an array
- A method which can return either a result or get an error and return nothing, like trying to read a file's contents (which normally returns the file's data) but the file doesn't exist
- Delegate properties, which don't always have to be set and are generally set after initialization
- For weak properties in classes. The thing they point to can be set to nil at any time
- A large resource that might have to be released to reclaim memory
- When you need a way to know when a value has been set (data not yet loaded > the data) instead of using a separate dataLoaded Boolean

- Optionals don't exist in Objective-C but there is an equivalent concept, returning nil.
