What Is A Type?
First things first. The Swift programming language uses types, like classes and structs, to represent different kinds of data in your app’s code.

Some examples:

Int is used for integer values, or “whole numbers”
Double is used for decimal-point values, like 3.1415
String is used for text, like "Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"
UIButton is used for a button user interface element
