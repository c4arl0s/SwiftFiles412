Type casting in swift : difference between is, as, as?, as!
What is the difference between is, as, as?, as! in swift? Well, lets check.

Apple doc says: 

Type casting is a way to check the type of an instance, or to treat that instance as a different superclass or subclass from somewhere else in its own class hierarchy.

Type casting in Swift is implemented with the is and as operators. 

is is used to check the type of a value 
whereas as is used to cast a value to a different type.
