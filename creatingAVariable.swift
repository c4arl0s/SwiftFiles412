#!/usr/bin/swift

// Declare a new variable with var, followed by a name, type, and value: var num: Int = 10
// Variables can have their values changed:

// num = 20 // num now equals 20 Unless they're defined with let:
let num: Int = 10 // num cannot change

// Swift infers the type of variable, so you don't always have to declare variable type:

let ten = 10 // num is an Int
let pi = 3.14 // pi is a Double
let floatPi: Float = 3.14 // floatPi is a Float

print(ten)
print(pi))
print(floatPi)

// Variable names aren't restricted to letters and numbers - they can also contain most other unicode characters, although there are some restrictions
